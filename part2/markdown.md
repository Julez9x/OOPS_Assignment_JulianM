## Question 3

Branch - Different locations for different stages of your process.
Pull - Download files from Github.
Push - Finalises upload to Github.
Repository - Copy of a codebase.
Working Copy - 
Merge - Merge different files/branches together.

## Question 14

Github - Automation tool where developers can quickly edit and upload existing code. \
Jenkins - Testing tool which helped develop, handle and deliver the product and this requires fast and precise solution so the repetition continues. \
Buddy - Pipeline (CI/CD) tool which automates code upgrades and ensures changes are consistent with most recent code version.

## Question 15

Continuous Intergration and Continuous Delivery/Development - Detects any changes in the code version either updating it automatically or making you aware of changes. Makes sure the code will work on newer versions without you having to rewrite code.
